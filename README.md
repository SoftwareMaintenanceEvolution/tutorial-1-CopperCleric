# Introduction
Hi! I'm Wu Bang, a student in the WIF3006 Software Maintenance and Evolution course. I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I love playing basketball in my free time.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in maintaining and evolving software, and to enhance my ability to tackle real-world software issues efficiently.
